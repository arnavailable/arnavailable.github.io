Accomplished data scientist with 2+ years professional work experience with cutting-edge data teams at industry-leading firms. I have a knack for converting numbers into narratives and enabling digital transformations for businesses using data. I thrive at the intersection of business and technology.

Currently a MS Business Analytics candidate at UCLA Anderson School of Management.

I hold a Bachelor in Technology degree in Computer Science & Engineering from Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India. I gained a strong foundation in programming, algorithms and data structures. This equips me with a strong technical background to complement the analytical skills necessary for data-driven-decision making.
